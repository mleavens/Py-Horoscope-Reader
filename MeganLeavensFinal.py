"""Horoscope reader. This program asks the user for their birth month and birth day.
Based on the users answer, it tells them what their zodiac sign is.
The program then uses this information to gather their personalized
horoscope, mood, compatibility, color,lucky number and lucky time
from the aztro API imported after installing pip intall requests in terminal.
It then gives the user their gemstone and the gemstone meaning
based on the month they were born in.
Lastly, it asks the user for their birth year and presents their Chinese zodiac sign."""
